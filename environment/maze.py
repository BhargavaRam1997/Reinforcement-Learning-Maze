class Maze:
    """ A maze with walls. An agent is placed at the start cell and moves through the maze to get to the exit cell.

        The layout of the maze and the rules how to move through it are called the environment. An agent is placed
        at start_cell. The agent chooses actions (move left/right/up/down) in order to reach the exit_cell. Every
        action results in a reward or penalty which are accumulated during the game. Every move gives a small
        penalty (-0.04), returning to a cell the agent visited earlier a bigger penalty(-0.25) and running into
        a wall a large penalty (-0.75). A large reward (+10) is collected when the agent reaches the exit. The
        game always reaches a terminal state; the agent either wins or looses. Obviously reaching the exit means
        winning, but if the penalties the agent is collecting during play exceed a certain threshold the agent is
        assumed to wander around cluelessly and looses.

        A note on cell coordinates:
        The cells in the maze are stored as (col, row) or (x, y) tuples. (0, 0) is the upper left corner of the maze.
        This way of storing coordinates is in line with what matplotlibs plot() function expects as inputs. The maze
        itself is stored as a 2D numpy array so cells are accessed via [row, col]. To convert a (col, row) tuple
        to (row, col) use: (col, row)[::-1]
